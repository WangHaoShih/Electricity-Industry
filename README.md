# Data Science in the U.S. Electricity Industry

Applications of Advanced Modeling and Inference Techniques.

The energy sector in the United States is vast and complex, with electricity playing a central role in powering cities, industries, and homes while supporting millions of jobs critical to the economy. Given the multifaceted nature of energy, there are numerous approaches to understanding and analyzing its market dynamics. In our research, we focused on two key questions that explore different aspects of the energy sector.
Electricity demand is a fundamental component of societal functioning, making it essential to understand the factors driving this demand. By identifying the causes of electricity consumption, we can better forecast future trends and plan accordingly. Understanding the environmental and economic implications of electricity use is also crucial for both policymakers and utility companies. This led us to ask, “How effectively can temperature and additional contextual features predict electricity sales across U.S. states?” This question aims to explore how various factors, including temperature, influence electricity demand and provide insights into more accurate forecasting.
